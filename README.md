# Real-Time-Asset-Tracking-using-RFID-Technology-for-Inventory-Management-
The aim of the project was to make an accessory for a conventional fridge by converting it to a smart fridge which can keep track of things kept inside it and display exact amount of inventory inside on an LCD outside. The aim was to track the contents of the fridge by scanning them first and constantly updating a local database for all the addition and the subtractions to the fridge. Trends were studied using the  data in the database to be better prepared for future stocking of the fridge. Raspberry Pi was used for the project. It also provided better tracking of products and sales.
